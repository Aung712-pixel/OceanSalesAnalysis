# 🛒 Grocery Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard

This project involves end-to-end data analysis of a grocery dataset sourced from a retail chain, aimed at uncovering business insights and presenting them through a clear, interactive dashboard.

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this project was to:
- Clean and preprocess a raw dataset
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Derive actionable insights based on outlet and item characteristics
- Design a professional, filterable dashboard for business stakeholders

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes sales data from a grocery chain, containing attributes like:
- **Outlet Size & Type**
- **Location Tier**
- **Item Type & Fat Content**
- **Sales Amounts**
- **Outlet Establishment Year**
- **Item Visibility & MRP**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Excel (for preprocessing & visualization)
- Excel Dashboard
- Data visualization libraries (if applicable)

---

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., outlet types, item types)
- Filtered and validated key numeric ranges

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- One-hot encoded categorical features (if using Python)
- Calculated derived fields (e.g., total sales by category)
- Grouped data by outlet and item segments

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified key contributors to total sales
- Analyzed performance based on:
  - Outlet size (Small, Medium, High)
  - Location tier (Tier 1, 2, 3)
  - Item fat content (Low Fat, Regular)
  - Item category (Fruits, Dairy, Beverages, etc.)

### 4. Visualization & Dashboard
- Designed interactive elements (filters by outlet size, location, item type)
- Highlighted KPIs like:
  - Total Sales: $1.20M
  - Average Sales per Item: $141
  - Total Items: 8,523
  - Average Customer Rating: 4.0
- Visual elements include:
  - Pie charts for outlet size & fat content
  - Bar charts for item categories and sales
  - Line chart showing outlet establishment trends

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Tier 3 locations** generated the highest total sales ($472.1K)
- **Regular fat content items** contributed 65% of overall revenue
- **Fruits & Vegetables** were the top-selling item category
- **Supermarket Type 1** had the highest total sales among outlet types

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Integrate dynamic slicers using Power BI or Tableau
- Incorporate time series forecasting for sales trends
- Apply clustering or segmentation for customer behavior insights
- Use Python to automate data processing pipelines
